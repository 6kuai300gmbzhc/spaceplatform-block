spaceplatform-launch-rocket=launch rocket and discover planets
[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
spaceplatform-launch-rocket=In this mod, there are no planet surfaces available for landing except for [planet=sol]. \nFor some unknown reason, [planet=nauvis] must be unlocked, otherwise the star map cannot be seen. Players cannot reach the surface of [planet=nauvis]. \n\nSpace platforms are divided into two types: ordinary platforms and planet platforms. \nThe ordinary platform is created using [item=space-platform-starter-pack], which is consistent with the vanilla version. It can place engines and navigate, but cannot place [entity=rocket-silo]. \n\nThe planet platform is a platform created using [item=mothership-pack]. Unlike ordinary platforms, it cannot place engines or neither can navigate, but can place [entity=rocket-silo]. \nAdditionally, [planet=mothership] combines the characteristics of two platforms, allowing for both navigation and rocket launch. \n\nDue to other unknown reasons, there may be a situation where [entity=rocket-silo] cannot create a new space platform. In this case, the Create Space Platform button on the right side of the map interface or the Create Space Platform button in the shortcut bar can be used instead. Please select the correct startup package and set the planet as the planet where the target [entity=rocket-silo] is located (including [planet=mothership]). \n\nA planet can only have one corresponding planet platform, and after launching [item=mothership-pack], it will be gradually unlocked from near to far according to its distance from the sun. After the planet platform is destroyed, the corresponding planet will become unlocked and needs to launch [item=mothership-pack] again.\n\nOn [planet=mothership], a new ordinary platform can only be created using [item=space-platform-starter-pack] when it is anchored above a certain planet or sol. The created platform will automatically be generated in the orbit of the corresponding location. For [item=mothership-pack], there is no such restriction and it can be launched at will.Unlike the vanilla version, researching technology cannot unlock planets, only by launching [item=mothership-pack] can the planet be unlocked. \n\nThe surface of [planet=sol] can launch rockets to any planet platform, while planet platforms can only launch rockets to platforms anchored in their orbit. Although [planet=mothership] can place [entity=rocket-silo], it cannot launch rockets to other platforms.\n\n The materials exchange between platforms must be carried out through the planet platform, which means that both platforms are anchored in the same planet orbit. One platform releases materials to the planet platform through the hub, and then sends the materials to the other platform through rockets on the planet platform. The transfer of personnel is the same, after entering the hub, you can press Enter to exit.
